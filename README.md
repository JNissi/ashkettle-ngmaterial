Intro

This package provides an easy way to implement [Google Material Design](http://www.google.com/design/spec/material-design/introduction.html)
components in your Meteor apps which utilize Angular.

This is simply a wrapper around [Angular Material Design](https://material.angularjs.org/#/) and will work with any package providing Angular functionality with meteor, for example the excellent [Package by Urigo](http://angularjs.meteor.com/).

I take no credit in any of the fine work that went into this project.

Add the package with meteor add ashkettle:ngmeteor

Add a reference to the library in your module angular.module('blog',['angular-meteor','ngMaterial']);
